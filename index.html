    <p><big>is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal. A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning,
         which refers to the concept that computer programs can automatically learn from and adapt to new data without being assisted by humans.
         Deep learning techniques enable this automatic learning through the absorption of huge amounts of unstructured data such as text, images, or video.</big></p>

    <p><big>Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines.
            The goals of artificial intelligence include learning, reasoning, and perception.
            AI is being used across different industries including finance and healthcare.
            Weak AI tends to be simple and single-task oriented, while strong AI carries on tasks that are more complex
            and human-like.
            Understanding Artificial Intelligence (AI)
            When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first thing they usually think of is robots.
            That's because big-budget films and novels weave stories about human-like machines that wreak havoc on
            Earth. But nothing could be further from the truth.

    <p><big>hat human intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks,
            from the most simple to those that are even more complex. The goals of artificial intelligence include
            mimicking human cognitive activity.
            Researchers and developers in the field are making surprisingly rapid strides in mimicking activities such
            as learning, reasoning, and perception, to the extent that these can be concretely defined. Some believe
            that innovators may soon be able to develop systems that exceed the capacity of humans to learn or reason
            out any subject. B
            ut others remain skeptical because all cognitive activity is laced with value judgments that are subject to
            human experience.</big></p>

    </p>
    <p><big>As technology advances, previous benchmarks that defined artificial intelligence become outdated. For
            example,
            machines that calculate basic functions or recognize text through optical character recognition are no
            longer considered to embody artificial intelligence,
            since this function is now taken for granted as an inherent computer function</big></p>

    <p><big>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed
            to think like humans and mimic their actions.
            The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as
            learning and problem-solving.</big></p>
